I am **Luis Denninger**, a first-year PhD at the Technical University of Munich, and this is my webpage.

## Acknowledgement
I started off from the template from [Hanlin Cai](https://github.com/GuangLun2000/GuangLun2000.github.io) and slowly adapted his webpage to fit my personal preference. Still, major parts are from him and I want to thank him for sharing his personal webpage!
