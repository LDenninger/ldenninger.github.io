# About Me

<img src="/assets/images/personal/RoboCup_finals_image.png" class="floatpic">

Hi, I'm **Luis Denninger**, a first-year PhD student at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) in the Computer Vision Group of [Prof. Daniel Cremers](https://cvg.cit.tum.de/members/cremers). Simultaneously, I'm working as a Computer Vision Scientist at [DeepScenario](https://www.deepscenario.com/) under the guidance of [Dr. Jacques Kaiser](https://jacqueskaiser.com/).

Previously, I have completed my B.Sc in Computer Science at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/de) under the guidance of [Prof. Sven Behnke](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/behnke/) with a focus on robotics. Under his guidance, I have worked as a student research assistant in the successful [NimbRo RoboCup Soccer](https://www.nimbro.net/Humanoid/index.html) team becoming world champions in 2023 and winning the best humanoid award in 2024. Further, I have co-founded the [Roboracer](https://roboracer.ai/) team *LAMARRacing* achieving the quarter-finals in our first world championship. With a strong focus on computer vision, I have completed my M.Sc under the supervision of [Prof. Juergen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/) at the University of Bonn in 2025.

I am always open for discussions and collaborations. I have open guided research and student thesis positions! Please feel free to reach out to me at **luis.denninger [at] tum.de**
